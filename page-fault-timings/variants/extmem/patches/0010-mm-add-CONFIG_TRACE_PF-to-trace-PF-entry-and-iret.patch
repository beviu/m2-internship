Subject: [PATCH 10/14] mm: add CONFIG_TRACE_PF to trace PF entry and iret

Add trace points around the page fault ISR to measure the time of entry
and exit when CONFIG_TRACE_PF is enabled.

Applications opt into tracing by setting ebx to 0xb141a52a before doing
a page fault. When active and a page fault occurs, the TSC at ISR entry
is saved in rax, the TSC before ISR return is saved in rcx, and rdx will
be clobbered.

+	  This option enables debugging code to read and save the TSC:
+	  1. on page fault entry to make it possible to measure the time between the
+	     fault and the exception handler starting to execute, and
+	  2. right before iret is called to make it possible to measure the time
+	     between the iret and the return to user space.

+	  This is only active when ebx contains the value 0xb141a52a before a page
